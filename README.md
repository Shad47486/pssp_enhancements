# pssp_enhancements

1. Update the landing page to look more like a fake patient portal (11/22 4:00pm completed)

2. Create another new account type called: care provider
The care provider should have permissions to edit existing patients
There should be a new endpoint for creating this account type; and a new dropdown field value within SQL for account_type

3. Enable edit functionality for profile
Should be able to update email, username
